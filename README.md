# Polars Tests
This repo contains a few example usages of the [Polars](https://pola.rs/) API for typical EDA/ML tasks. I use it mostly 
as a personal reference in my journey migrating from Pandas to Polars. It works also as a source of MRE for the numerous
questions I'm asking on StackOverflow/ to ChatGPT, while learning to use Polars. I'm sharing it here because I love Polars,
and I hope it could help someone else on their path to learning to use it ðŸ™‚. PRs welcome!
